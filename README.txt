GETTING STARTED

Double-clicking on the executable at the top level of the relevant directory should start the
program. For Windows and Linux users, it is important that the "lib" directory remains in the
same directory as the executable.

After a brief start-up sequence, the window should show a zoomed-in map. In the panel to the left
is a list of results to display, divided into genetic (A) shared environmental (C) and non-shared
environmental (E) components, and a histogram. Clicking on the list should bring up the relevant
results on the maps and the histogram. The list can be scrolled by dragging the slider to the right
of the list up and down.

The histogram in the left-hand panel shows the distribution of the selected (highlighted) result
across the whole map. The colours in the histogram match the colours of the points on both of the
maps, with bright blue representing low values and bright red representing high values, fading
through purple in the mid-range. The x axis of the histogram refers to the proportion of the
variance in the phenotype explained, and the y axis gives the frequency of the points. So if
"Language A" is selected in the list, red areas on the map refer to regions where heritability is
relatively high, and the blue areas are regions where heritability is low. Selecting "Language C"
or "Language E" will display the corresponding environmental components.

The small map in the top right corner provides an overview of the whole of the UK. The TEDS sample
was recruited in England and Wales, so there is far more data available in the south than there is
in Scotland. The white rectangle shows the area covered by the large-scale map in the main window.
One way to navigate the large-scale map is to click on an area of interest in the small map. The
main window will glide to centre on the new location. The "+" and "-" symbols in the top right hand
corner allow the map in the main window to be zoomed in and out by one level per click (on start-up,
the main map is fully zoomed in). The map can also be zoomed in and out using the up and down arrows
on the keyboard.

A second way to control the view in the main window is by clicking and dragging on the main map. The
"Data" button to the bottom right of the main map view toggles the visibility of the data points in
the main map to make it easier to read the underlying place names. Hovering the mouse over data
points in the main map view pops up a tooltip with the exact value at that data point. At the same
time, a small white triangle marks the position of that value in the histogram at the lower left.

Clicking and dragging the bottom right-hand corner resizes the main window.
